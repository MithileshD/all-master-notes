All-React
Will you update or mutate react state? 
Since state is considered read only so you should replace it with a new updated state, rather than mutate your existing object.

Since state is considered read only so you should replace it with a new updated state, rather than mutate your existing object.  

Wrong: setAge(age+1)  
Correct: setAge(prevAge => prevAge + 1)  

What can we put in componentWillUnmount ? 
This is called just before a component is removed from the DOM. It's a crucial place to perform cleanup tasks, such as clearing timers, unsubscribing from events, or releasing resources to prevent memory leaks.
